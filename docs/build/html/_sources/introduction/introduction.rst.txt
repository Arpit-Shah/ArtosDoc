ARTOS (Art of System Testing) 
*****************************
ARTOS was developed by bunch of experienced test engineers for test developers/engineers. It was designed and developed with the aim to provide a test framework which is easy to use, reliable and works out of the box. ARTOS is written in Java which makes it suitable for Windows, Linux, MAC or any other platform that runs Java. It can be used for functional, system, end to end or unit testing. Most of the test frameworks only provide test runner/executor and rest is left on engineers to develop, Whereas Artos comes with many inbuilt and well tested utilities saving time for users to focus on what they do best!
